# Using language models to detect victim blaming: when are victims blamed the most in the case of femicide newspaper articles in Italy


## Repository for my Master's thesis 

This repository contains the scripts used for my Master Thesis. They can be found in the "scripts" folder. They are sorted in the order to be followed to reproduce the research. Unfortunately the article data that I used cannot be published because of copyright. The "00_Scraping" script contains the code to retrieve the links and the articles.
